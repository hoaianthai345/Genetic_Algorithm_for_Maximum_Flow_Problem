This is a final project for the Artificial Intelligence course at UEH, implementing a Genetic Algorithm (GA) to solve the Maximum Network Flow problem. The system includes a custom visualization interface, parameter controls, and comparative analysis with Ford–Fulkerson algorithm.

- 📍 Course: Artificial Intelligence – UEH
- 👨‍🏫 Instructor: PhD. Đặng Ngọc Hoàng Thành
- 👨‍💻 Technologies: Python, PyQt, GA, Graph Theory
- 📁 Report: [`AI-Final-Report-Vietnamese.pdf`]
